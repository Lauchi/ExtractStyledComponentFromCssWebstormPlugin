To get it running, you have to add the following webstorm libraries to the classpath:

...Webstorm/Contents/plugins/JavaScriptLanguage/lib/*
...Webstorm/Contents/plugins/CSS/lib/*
...Webstorm/Contents/plugins/sass/lib/*

You also need to do all the plugin sdk installation stuff, see on the intellij site.
